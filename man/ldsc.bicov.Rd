\arguments{
\item{gwas1}{A data.frame containing GWAS summary statistics for the first trait. The data.frame should include columns for SNP identifiers, Z-scores of effect size estimates, sample sizes (N), effect allele (A1), and reference allele (A2).}

\item{gwas2}{A data.frame containing GWAS summary statistics for the second trait. The data.frame should include columns for SNP identifiers, Z-scores of effect size estimates, sample sizes (N), effect allele (A1), and reference allele (A2).}

\item{h1}{The heritability of the first trait.}

\item{h2}{The heritability of the second trait.}

\item{LDSC}{A data.frame containing LD Score Regression (LDSC) estimates. It should include LDSC scores and other necessary metrics for the analysis.}

\item{zsquare_thresh}{A threshold for the squared Z-scores in heritability estimation to control for extreme values.}

\item{nblock}{The number of blocks for bootstrap-based standard error estimation.}

\item{sampling.time}{The number of block bootstrap.}

\item{sampling.ratio}{The sub-sampling ratio in each bootstrap.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing heritability estimates and their standard errors, along with the intercept and its standard error.
}
\description{
The `ldsc.bicov` function performs single-variate Linkage Disequilibrium Score Regression (LDSC) analysis. It is designed to estimate genetic covariance from two GWAS summary statistics, accounting for linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs.
}
\details{
The `ldsc.bicov` function is particularly useful for the estimation of genetic covariance of two traits using LDSC. It requires well-formatted GWAS summary statistics and an understanding of LDSC methodology. The function includes an initial estimation phase followed by a reweighting step for improved efficiency and accuracy. It finally applies a blokc-wise bootstrap to estimate the standard error.
